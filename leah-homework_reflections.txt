Thinking about the program you worked on today:

1. How similar was your plan to the final program? Did you have to digress from your plan as the program developed?
2. Does each of your classes follow the Single Responsibility principle? Or are any of your classes doing too much?
3. Did you practice TDD?
4. Are each of your methods tested? Did you find anything difficult to test?

Answers:

1. Our plan was somewhat similar to our final program, but we had to add a few things. Additionally, we did more in our HiddenWord class than we anticipated.

2. We followed the Single Responsibility Principle generally. Though it is debatable if we ended up putting too much into one particular function in the HiddenWord class. 

3. We did practice TDD. This was definitely helpful for building the more complex check_guess function. 

4. Yes, all our methods are tested except for the make_a_guess function in the Game class. We did not have time to finish that part. The complex check_guess function was difficult to test because we were not sure what all the various interior methods were doing. For that, we ended up testing a few using simplified versions in irb.
